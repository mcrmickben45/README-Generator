## Introduction

Developers often find themselves in need of a quick and efficient way to generate professional README files for their projects. The README generator, driven by a command-line application, fulfills this requirement. When prompted for information about the application repository, users can input details such as the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, chosen license, GitHub username, and email address. The generated README.md file includes sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Notably, the chosen license is accompanied by a badge at the top of the README, providing clear licensing information.

This tool streamlines the process of creating a comprehensive and polished README, enhancing the overall documentation for developers' projects.
